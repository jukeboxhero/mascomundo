module ActsAsReviewable
  # including this module into your Review model will give you finders and named scopes
  # useful for working with Reviews.
  # The named scopes are:
  # in_order: Returns reviews in the order they were created (created_at ASC).
  # recent: Returns reviews by how recently they were created (created_at DESC).
  # limit(N): Return no more than N reviews.
